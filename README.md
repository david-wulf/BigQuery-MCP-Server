## All 38 tools

### BigQuery exclusive (14)

These use BigQuery capabilities the Search Console API simply doesn't have.

| Tool | What it answers |
|---|---|
| `gsc_anonymous_traffic` | How much traffic is hidden behind anonymous queries? The API hides ~46% of clicks entirely. |
| `gsc_genai_conversation_queries` | Which queries are AI conversation fragments? Seven kinds sorted, no API row limits, plus the anonymised split the API can't see. |
| `gsc_forecast` | ARIMA_PLUS traffic forecasting via BigQuery ML. Predict clicks up to 365 days out. |
| `gsc_anomalies` | ML anomaly detection. Flags genuinely unusual traffic patterns, not just threshold breaches. |
| `gsc_seasonal` | Year over year monthly comparison. Spot seasonal patterns with YoY percentage changes. |
| `gsc_device_split` | Queries where mobile and desktop rank entirely different pages from your site. |
| `gsc_intent_breakdown` | Classify all queries by search intent: informational, transactional, commercial, navigational. |
| `gsc_ngrams` | Extract recurring terms from queries. Find themes your content should cover. |
| `gsc_new_keywords` | Queries appearing in recent data that weren't present before. |
| `gsc_query_count` | How many distinct queries a site, section or single URL is visible for, by position group, over time, against the previous period. Counts the whole export instead of a 1,000-row page, and reads the anonymised share from `is_anonymized_query` instead of inferring it. |
| `gsc_discover` | Google Discover performance: clicks, impressions, CTR, share of all surfaces, time series, top URLs, country split. Page-based, with its own `is_anonymized_discover` flag. |
| `gsc_click_curve` | Your own click curve: CTR per rank measured on your data, not borrowed from a study. Segment by device, country, surface, or branded vs non-branded. Also reports the clicks it cannot cover. |
| `gsc_image_search` | Google Images: clicks, impressions, CTR, position, share of all surfaces, top pages and queries, AMP image results. `url` is the hosting page, not the image file. |
| `gsc_shopping` | Organic shopping surfaces: free product listings, merchant listings, product snippets. Search appearances inside WEB rows, so they cross freely with url, query, device and date - unlike the API's `searchAppearance` dimension. |

### GSC analysis (12)

The same analysis tools from the [GSC MCP server](https://github.com/Suganthan-Mohanadasan/Suganthans-GSC-MCP), rebuilt to run on BigQuery's unsampled data.

| Tool | What it answers |
|---|---|
| `gsc_quick_wins` | Keywords at positions 4 to 15 with high impressions, scored by opportunity |
| `gsc_ctr_opportunities` | Pages with high impressions but CTR below expected for their position |
| `gsc_content_gaps` | Topics with search demand but no real content targeting them |
| `gsc_site_snapshot` | How is the site doing overall? Clicks, impressions, CTR, position with period comparison |
| `gsc_content_decay` | Pages declining across three consecutive 30 day periods |
| `gsc_cannibalisation` | Keywords where multiple pages compete against each other |
| `gsc_traffic_drops` | What lost traffic, and whether it's a ranking loss, CTR collapse, or demand decline |
| `gsc_topic_cluster` | Aggregated performance for all pages matching a URL path pattern |
| `gsc_ctr_benchmark` | Your actual CTR per position vs industry benchmarks |
| `gsc_alerts` | Position drops, CTR collapses, click losses, disappeared pages. Severity rated |
| `gsc_content_recommendations` | Prioritised actions: pages to update, content to create, pages to consolidate |
| `gsc_report` | Full markdown performance report |

### GA4 + GSC blending (6, new in v4.0)

Require the GA4 BigQuery export running alongside GSC in the same project. Set `BIGQUERY_GA4_DATASET` (or pass `ga4_dataset` per call). [Full setup guide](https://suganthan.com/blog/google-analytics-bigquery-mcp-server/).

| Tool | What it answers |
|---|---|
| `ga4_gsc_query_revenue` | Which search queries actually drive revenue and conversions? Proportional attribution by click share. |
| `ga4_gsc_content_roi` | Which pages have the biggest gap between rankings and conversions? Diagnoses each page. |
| `ga4_gsc_position_value` | What is each search position worth on your site? Conversion rate and revenue per click by position bucket. |
| `ga4_gsc_snippet_mismatch` | Which pages have misleading or underselling snippets? |
| `ga4_gsc_branded_performance` | How does branded vs non-branded traffic convert? |
| `ga4_gsc_page_performance` | Full page-level search + analytics metrics joined per landing page. |

### General purpose (6)

Work with any BigQuery dataset, not just GSC.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `query` | Run any SELECT query. Claude writes the SQL for you. |
| `query_cost_estimate` | Dry run to see bytes scanned before executing. |
| `list_datasets` | Discover available datasets in your project. |
| `list_tables` | All tables and schemas in a dataset. |
| `describe_table` | Column types, row counts, partitioning, size. |
| `sample_rows` | Preview rows without writing SQL. |

## Why BigQuery instead of the GSC API?

| | GSC API | BigQuery bulk export |
|---|---------|---------------------|
| Sampling | Sampled at high volumes | Unsampled |
| Anonymous queries | Hidden entirely | Included |
| History | Rolling 16 months | Permanent (forward only, no backfill) |
| Query flexibility | Fixed parameters | Any SQL you want |
| ML capabilities | None | ARIMA forecasting, anomaly detection |
| Cost | Free | ~$12 to $24/year |

Both complement each other. Use the [GSC MCP server](https://github.com/Suganthan-Mohanadasan/Suganthans-GSC-MCP) for quick real time lookups. Use this for deeper analysis.

## What makes this different

**Analysis, not just queries.** Most BigQuery tools give you raw SQL access. This ships with 27 pre-built SEO analysis tools: opportunity scoring, cannibalisation detection, decay tracking, CTR benchmarking, traffic drop diagnosis, ML forecasting, AI conversation-query detection, and GA4 + GSC revenue attribution. You ask a question, it runs the analysis and tells you what to do.

**ML built in.** ARIMA_PLUS traffic forecasting and anomaly detection run directly in BigQuery. No external services, no extra cost beyond standard BigQuery pricing.

**Hallucination guardrails.** Every tool instructs Claude to base analysis only on returned data. Provenance metadata in every response. Exact numbers, no speculation, insufficient data flagged.

**Visual dashboards.** Results render as rich, interactive visualisations in Claude Desktop. Summary cards, colour coded indicators, bar charts, and tabbed sections. Not plain text dumps.

**Read only. Cost controlled.** Only SELECT queries allowed. All mutations blocked. Auto-LIMIT on queries, 10GB bytes billed cap, dry run cost preview. EXPORT, CALL, and EXECUTE statements blocked.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BIGQUERY_PROJECT_ID` | Yes | Your Google Cloud project ID |
| `BIGQUERY_KEY_FILE` | No | Path to service account JSON key (falls back to `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`) |
| `BIGQUERY_DEFAULT_DATASET` | No | Default dataset for queries (e.g. `searchconsole`) |
| `BIGQUERY_LOCATION` | No | Default dataset location (default: `US`). Set to `EU`, `asia-southeast1`, etc. if needed. |
| `BIGQUERY_DATASET_LOCATIONS` | No | Per-dataset location overrides for projects whose datasets live in different regions. Format: `dataset:location,project.dataset:location` (e.g. `searchconsole_old:europe-west3,analytics_123456789:EU`). Datasets not listed fall back to `BIGQUERY_LOCATION`. A query touching datasets in two different locations is rejected with a clear error, because BigQuery cannot join across locations. |
| `BIGQUERY_GA4_DATASET` | No | GA4 export dataset name (e.g. `analytics_123456789`). Only needed for the 6 `ga4_gsc_*` blending tools. |

## Changelog

**v4.1.0** Generative AI conversation queries, the BigQuery twin. `gsc_genai_conversation_queries` finds the AI conversation fragments hiding in your query data and sorts them into seven kinds: reply artefacts, pivot follow-ups, conversational questions, tracker probes, agent harnesses, pasted strings, and a review pile. Same classifier as the [GSC MCP](https://github.com/Suganthan-Mohanadasan/Suganthans-GSC-MCP) version, run over the bulk export instead of the API, so there are no serving limits on large sites, windows anchor to the export's real freshness, and it reports the anonymised split: how many of your impressions carry no query string at all, which is where most of the conversation pool hides (57.7% on the reference property). John Mueller made the same point on LinkedIn the day it launched: large sites will find more of these queries in the export than any other route returns. Total tools now 33. Full method and findings: [the launch post](https://suganthan.com/blog/ai-mode-queries-search-console/).

**v4.0.0** GA4 integration. 6 new tools that blend GA4 conversion and revenue data with GSC search data: `ga4_gsc_query_revenue`, `ga4_gsc_content_roi`, `ga4_gsc_position_value`, `ga4_gsc_snippet_mismatch`, `ga4_gsc_branded_performance`, and `ga4_gsc_page_performance`. Requires the GA4 BigQuery export running alongside GSC and one extra environment variable (`BIGQUERY_GA4_DATASET`). Total tools now 32. Full setup guide: [GA4 + GSC in BigQuery](https://suganthan.com/blog/google-analytics-bigquery-mcp-server/).

![Keyword revenue attribution demo: queries joined to GA4 conversion and revenue data via proportional click share](screenshots/ga4-keyword-revenue.jpg)

**v3.1.0** Visual dashboard rendering. All GSC analysis tools now produce rich, interactive visualisations in Claude Desktop with summary cards, colour coded indicators, bar charts, and tabbed sections instead of plain text output. No reinstall needed, just restart Claude Desktop.

![Visual dashboard rendering in Claude Desktop](screenshots/visual-dashboard.jpg)

**v3.0.0** Initial release with 26 tools: 8 BigQuery exclusives (anonymous traffic, ML forecasting, anomaly detection, seasonal analysis, device split, intent breakdown, N-grams, new keywords), 12 GSC analysis tools, and 6 general purpose BigQuery tools.
